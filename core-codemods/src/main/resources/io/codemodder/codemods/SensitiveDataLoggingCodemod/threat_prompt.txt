This security threat only applies to code that logs sensitive data, such as passwords, access tokens, API keys, session IDs, and social security numbers.

Logs are often the target of data breaches or the source of accidental data leaks. Keeping sensitive data out of logs is a simple way to address this issue.

In your analysis, please answer the following:
- Does the code log any messages containing sensitive data? If so, at what log severity?
- Does the code print any messages containing sensitive data?
- Is any of the sensitive data included in plaintext?

Examples of LOW risk:
- code does not log or print any sensitive data
- code only logs sensitive data at DEBUG or TRACE severities
- code anonymizes or masks all sensitive data in messages

Examples of HIGH risk:
- code logs any plaintext sensitive data at INFO or higher severities
- code prints any plaintext sensitive data using `System.out.println`
