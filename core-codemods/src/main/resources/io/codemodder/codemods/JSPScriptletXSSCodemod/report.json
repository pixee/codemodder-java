However, depending on the context in which the scriptlet is rendered (e.g., inside an HTML tag, in JavaScript, unquoted contexts, etc.), you may need to use another encoding method. Check out the [OWASP XSS Prevention CheatSheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to learn more about these cases and other controls you may need in exceptional cases. The security control introduced from OWASP used has `forHtml()` variants for all situations (e.g., `forJavaScript()`, `forCssString()`).",
