This change eliminates commented-out code that may impede readability and distract focus. Any deleted code can still be accessed through the source control history if needed.

Our changes look something like this:

```diff
   catch (IOException e) { 
-    // LOG.error("Unexpected problem ", ex);
     return handleError(ex);
   }
```
