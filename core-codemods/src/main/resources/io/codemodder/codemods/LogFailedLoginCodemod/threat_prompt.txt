This security threat only applies to code that validates user login credentials (e.g. a username and password). Code is vulnerable to this threat if it does not log failed login attempts.

Logging failed login attempts is important for security reasons, as it can help detect and prevent brute force attacks and other malicious activities.

In your analysis, please answer the following:
- Does the code include login validation?
- What logging framework does the code use? Does the code log any messages when login validation fails?
- Does the code print any messages to the console when login validation fails?
- Does the code throw any exceptions when login validation fails? If so, this may be considered logging.

Examples of LOW risk:
- code does not validate user login credentials
- code logs any message at any level when login validation fails
- code prints to the console using `System.out.println` when login validation fails
- code throws any type of exception when login validation fails

Examples of HIGH risk:
- when login validation fails, code does not log or print a message or throw an exception
