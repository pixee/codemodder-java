If you enable debugging features, this can make your code vulnerable by adding entry points, or leaking sensitive information.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that debugging features are not enabled in production builds, such as by guarding calls to `WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)` by a flag that is only enabled in debug builds.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, WebView debugging is always enabled. whereas the GOOD case only enables it if the `android:debuggable` attribute is set to `true`.\n\n\n```java\n// BAD - debugging is always enabled \nWebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);\n\n// GOOD - debugging is only enabled when this is a debug build, as indicated by the debuggable flag being set.\nif (0 != (getApplicationInfo().flags & ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE)) {\n    WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Android Developers: [setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(boolean)).\n* Android Developers: [Remote debugging WebViews](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-489](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html).\n"

That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information.\n\n\n```java\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n\ttry {\n\t\tdoSomeWork();\n\t} catch (NullPointerException ex) {\n\t\t// BAD: printing a exception message back to the response\n\t\tresponse.sendError(\n\t\t\tHttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n\t\t\tex.getMessage());\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\ttry {\n\t\tdoSomeWork();\n\t} catch (NullPointerException ex) {\n\t\t// GOOD: log the exception message, and send back a non-revealing response\n\t\tlog(\"Exception occurred\", ex.getMessage);\n\t\tresponse.sendError(\n\t\t\tHttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,\n\t\t\t\"Exception occurred\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* CERT Java Coding Standard: [ERR01-J.

It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming. If a Groovy script is built using attacker-controlled data, and then evaluated, then it may allow the attacker to achieve RCE.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is generally recommended to avoid using untrusted input in a Groovy evaluation. If this is not possible, use a sandbox solution. Developers must also take care that Groovy compile-time metaprogramming can also lead to RCE: it is possible to achieve RCE by compiling a Groovy script (see the article \"Abusing Meta Programming for Unauthenticated RCE!\" linked below). Groovy's `SecureASTCustomizer` allows securing source code by controlling what code constructs are permitted. This is typically done when using Groovy for its scripting or domain specific language (DSL) features. The fundamental problem is that Groovy is a dynamic language, yet `SecureASTCustomizer` works by looking at Groovy AST statically. This makes it very easy for an attacker to bypass many of the intended checks (see \\[Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful\\](https://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/)). Therefore, besides `SecureASTCustomizer`, runtime checks are also necessary before calling Groovy methods (see \\[Improved sandboxing of Groovy scripts\\](https://melix.github.io/blog/2015/03/sandboxing.html)). It is also possible to use a block-list method, excluding unwanted classes from being loaded by the JVM. This method is not always recommended, because block-lists can be bypassed by unexpected values.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data to evaluate a Groovy script.\n\n\n```java\npublic class GroovyInjection {\n    void injectionViaClassLoader(HttpServletRequest request) {    \n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        final GroovyClassLoader classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader();\n        Class groovy = classLoader.parseClass(script);\n        GroovyObject groovyObj = (GroovyObject) groovy.newInstance();\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaEval(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        Eval.me(script);\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaGroovyShell(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        shell.evaluate(script);\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaGroovyShellGroovyCodeSource(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        GroovyCodeSource gcs = new GroovyCodeSource(script, \"test\", \"Test\");\n        shell.evaluate(gcs);\n    }\n}\n\n\n```\nThe following example uses classloader block-list approach to exclude loading dangerous classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic class SandboxGroovyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n    public SandboxGroovyClassLoader(ClassLoader parent) {\n        super(parent);\n    }\n\n    /* override `loadClass` here to prevent loading sensitive classes, such as `java.lang.Runtime`, `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`, `java.lang.System`, etc.  */\n    /* Note we must also block `groovy.transform.ASTTest`, `groovy.lang.GrabConfig` and `org.buildobjects.process.ProcBuilder` to prevent compile-time RCE. */\n\n    static void runWithSandboxGroovyClassLoader() throws Exception {\n        // GOOD: route all class-loading via sand-boxing classloader.\n        SandboxGroovyClassLoader classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader(new SandboxGroovyClassLoader());\n        \n        Class<?> scriptClass = classLoader.parseClass(untrusted.getQueryString());\n        Object scriptInstance = scriptClass.newInstance();\n        Object result = scriptClass.getDeclaredMethod(\"bar\", new Class[]{}).invoke(scriptInstance, new Object[]{});\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Orange Tsai: [Abusing Meta Programming for Unauthenticated RCE!](https://blog.orange.tw/2019/02/abusing-meta-programming-for-unauthenticated-rce.html).\n* Cédric Champeau: [Improved sandboxing of Groovy scripts](https://melix.github.io/blog/2015/03/sandboxing.html).\n* Kohsuke Kawaguchi: [Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful](https://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/).\n* Welk1n: [Groovy Injection payloads](https://github.com/welk1n/exploiting-groovy-in-Java/).\n* Charles Chan: [Secure Groovy Script Execution in a Sandbox](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/secure-groovy-script-execution-in-a-sandbox-ea39f80ee87/).\n* Eugene: [Scripting and sandboxing in a JVM environment](https://stringconcat.com/en/scripting-and-sandboxing/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n",

The expression `x + y` is cast to the type of the left-hand side of the assignment: `short`, possibly leading to information loss.\n\nTo avoid implicitly narrowing the type of `x + y`, change the type of `x` to `int`.

                  "markdown": "# Implicit narrowing conversion in compound assignment\nCompound assignment statements of the form `x += y` or `x *= y` perform an implicit narrowing conversion if the type of `x` is narrower than the type of `y`. For example, `x += y` is equivalent to `x = (T)(x + y)`, where `T` is the type of `x`. This can result in information loss and numeric errors such as overflows.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that the type of the left-hand side of the compound assignment statement is at least as wide as the type of the right-hand side.\n\n\n## Example\nIf `x` is of type `short` and `y` is of type `int`, the expression `x + y` is of type `int`. However, the expression `x += y` is equivalent to `x = (short) (x + y)`. The expression `x + y` is cast to the type of the left-hand side of the assignment: `short`, possibly leading to information loss.\n\nTo avoid implicitly narrowing the type of `x + y`, change the type of `x` to `int`. Then the types of `x` and `x + y` are both `int` and there is no need for an implicit cast.\n\n\n## References\n* J. Bloch and N. Gafter, *Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases*, Puzzle 9.

Note that this replacement may not be a simple drop-in replacement.\n\n## Example\nThe following validator could result in arbitrary Java code execution:\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.validation.ConstraintValidator;\nimport javax.validation.ConstraintValidatorContext;\nimport org.hibernate.validator.constraintvalidation.HibernateConstraintValidatorContext;\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class TestValidator implements ConstraintValidator<Object, String> {\n\n    public static class InterpolationHelper {\n\n        public static final char BEGIN_TERM = '{';\n        public static final char END_TERM = '}';\n        public static final char EL_DESIGNATOR = '$';\n        public static final char ESCAPE_CHARACTER = '\\\\';\n\n        private static final Pattern ESCAPE_MESSAGE_PARAMETER_PATTERN = Pattern.compile( \"([\\\\\" + ESCAPE_CHARACTER + BEGIN_TERM + END_TERM + EL_DESIGNATOR + \"])\" );\n\n        private InterpolationHelper() {\n        }\n\n        public static String escapeMessageParameter(String messageParameter) {\n            if ( messageParameter == null ) {\n                return null;\n            }\n            return ESCAPE_MESSAGE_PARAMETER_PATTERN.matcher( messageParameter ).replaceAll( Matcher.quoteReplacement( String.valueOf( ESCAPE_CHARACTER ) ) + \"$1\" );\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean isValid(String object, ConstraintValidatorContext constraintContext) {\n        String value = object + \" is invalid\";\n\n        // Bad: Bean properties (normally user-controlled) are passed directly to `buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate`\n        constraintContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate(value).addConstraintViolation().disableDefaultConstraintViolation();\n\n        // Good: Bean properties (normally user-controlled) are escaped \n        String escaped = InterpolationHelper.escapeMessageParameter(value);\n        constraintContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate(escaped).addConstraintViolation().disableDefaultConstraintViolation();\n\n        // Good: Bean properties (normally user-controlled) are parameterized\n        HibernateConstraintValidatorContext context = constraintContext.unwrap( HibernateConstraintValidatorContext.class );\n        context.addMessageParameter( \"prop\", object );\n        context.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate( \"{prop} is invalid\").addConstraintViolation();\n        return false;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Hibernate Reference Guide: [ConstraintValidatorContext](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#_the_code_constraintvalidatorcontext_code).\n* GitHub Security Lab research: [Bean validation](https://securitylab.github.com/research/bean-validation-RCE).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"

                  "markdown": "# `TrustManager` that accepts all certificates\nIf the `checkServerTrusted` method of a `TrustManager` never throws a `CertificateException`, it trusts every certificate. This allows an attacker to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack against the application, therefore breaking any security Transport Layer Security (TLS) gives.\n\nAn attack might look like this:\n\n1. The vulnerable program connects to `https://example.com`.\n1. The attacker intercepts this connection and presents a valid, self-signed certificate for `https://example.com`.\n1. The vulnerable program calls the `checkServerTrusted` method to check whether it should trust the certificate.\n1. The `checkServerTrusted` method of your `TrustManager` does not throw a `CertificateException`.\n1. The vulnerable program accepts the certificate and proceeds with the connection since your `TrustManager` implicitly trusted it by not throwing an exception.\n1. The attacker can now read the data your program sends to `https://example.com` and/or alter its replies while the program thinks the connection is secure.\n\n## Recommendation\nDo not use a custom `TrustManager` that trusts any certificate.

It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect` that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlUberspect sandbox = new JexlUberspectSandbox();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().uberspect(sandbox).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n\n  private static class JexlUberspectSandbox implements JexlUberspect {\n\n    private static final List<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES =\n              Arrays.asList(\"java.lang.Math\", \"java.util.Random\");\n\n    private final JexlUberspect uberspect = new JexlBuilder().create().getUberspect();\n\n    private void checkAccess(Object obj) {\n      if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(obj.getClass().getCanonicalName())) {\n        throw new AccessControlException(\"Not allowed\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getMethod(Object obj, String method, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getMethod(obj, method, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<PropertyResolver> getResolvers(JexlOperator op, Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getResolvers(op, obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader) {\n      uberspect.setClassLoader(loader);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getVersion() {\n      return uberspect.getVersion();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getConstructor(Object obj, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getConstructor(obj, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(resolvers, obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(resolvers, obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<?> getIterator(Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getIterator(obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlArithmetic.Uberspect getArithmetic(JexlArithmetic arithmetic) {\n      return uberspect.getArithmetic(arithmetic);\n    } \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons JEXL: [Project page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 2.1.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/javadocs/apidocs-2.1.1/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 3.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/index.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"

If the name being used to look up the object must be provided by the user, make sure that it's not in the form of an absolute URL or that it's the URL pointing to a trusted server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts a name from the user, which it uses to look up an object.\n\nIn the first example, the user provided name is used to look up an object.\n\nThe second example validates the name before using it to look up an object.\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.naming.Context;\nimport javax.naming.InitialContext;\n\npublic void jndiLookup(HttpServletRequest request) throws NamingException {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\");\n\n  Hashtable<String, String> env = new Hashtable<String, String>();\n  env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"com.sun.jndi.rmi.registry.RegistryContextFactory\");\n  env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"rmi://trusted-server:1099\");\n  InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(env);\n\n  // BAD: User input used in lookup\n  ctx.lookup(name);\n\n  // GOOD: The name is validated before being used in lookup\n  if (isValid(name)) {\n    ctx.lookup(name);\n  } else {\n    // Reject the request\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Oracle: [Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jndi/).\n* Black Hat materials: [A Journey from JNDI/LDAP Manipulation to Remote Code Execution Dream Land](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE-wp.pdf).\n* Veracode: [Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java](https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-74](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html).\n"

If possible build the LDAP query using framework helper methods, for example from Spring's `LdapQueryBuilder` and `LdapNameBuilder`, instead of string concatenation. Alternatively, escape user input using an appropriate LDAP encoding method, for example: `encodeForLDAP` or `encodeForDN` from OWASP ESAPI, `LdapEncoder.filterEncode` or `LdapEncoder.nameEncode` from Spring LDAP, or `Filter.encodeValue` from UnboundID library.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following examples, the code accepts an \"organization name\" and a \"username\" from the user, which it uses to query LDAP.\n\nThe first example concatenates the unvalidated and unencoded user input directly into both the DN (Distinguished Name) and the search filter used for the LDAP query. A malicious user could provide special characters to change the meaning of these queries, and search for a completely different set of values. The LDAP query is executed using Java JNDI API.\n\nThe second example uses the OWASP ESAPI library to encode the user values before they are included in the DN and search filters. This ensures the meaning of the query cannot be changed by a malicious user.\n\n\n```java\nimport javax.naming.directory.DirContext;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryBad(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // BAD: User input used in DN (Distinguished Name) without encoding\n  String dn = \"OU=People,O=\" + organizationName;\n\n  // BAD: User input used in search filter without encoding\n  String filter = \"username=\" + userName;\n\n  ctx.search(dn, filter, new SearchControls());\n}\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // ESAPI encoder\n  Encoder encoder = DefaultEncoder.getInstance();\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeOrganizationName = encoder.encodeForDN(organizationName);\n  String safeDn = \"OU=People,O=\" + safeOrganizationName;\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  String safeUsername = encoder.encodeForLDAP(username);\n  String safeFilter = \"username=\" + safeUsername;\n  \n  ctx.search(safeDn, safeFilter, new SearchControls());\n}\n```\nThe third example uses Spring `LdapQueryBuilder` to build an LDAP query. In addition to simplifying the building of complex search parameters, it also provides proper escaping of any unsafe characters in search filters. The DN is built using `LdapNameBuilder`, which also provides proper escaping.\n\n\n```java\nimport static org.springframework.ldap.query.LdapQueryBuilder.query;\nimport org.springframework.ldap.support.LdapNameBuilder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(@RequestParam String organizationName, @RequestParam String username) {\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeDn = LdapNameBuilder.newInstance()\n    .add(\"O\", organizationName)\n    .add(\"OU=People\")\n    .build().toString();\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  LdapQuery query = query()\n    .base(safeDn)\n    .where(\"username\").is(username);\n\n  ldapTemplate.search(query, new AttributeCheckAttributesMapper());\n}\n```\nThe fourth example uses `UnboundID` classes, `Filter` and `DN`, to construct a safe filter and base DN.\n\n\n```java\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.DN;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.RDN;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Filter;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, LDAPConnection c) {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  DN safeDn = new DN(new RDN(\"OU\", \"People\"), new RDN(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  Filter safeFilter = Filter.createEqualityFilter(\"username\", username);\n  \n  c.search(safeDn.toString(), SearchScope.ONE, safeFilter);\n}\n```\nThe fifth example shows how to build a safe filter and DN using the Apache LDAP API.\n\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.LdapConnection;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Dn;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Rdn;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequest;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequestImpl;\nimport static org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.search.FilterBuilder.equal;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, LdapConnection c) {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  Dn safeDn = new Dn(new Rdn(\"OU\", \"People\"), new Rdn(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  String safeFilter = equal(\"username\", username);\n  \n  SearchRequest searchRequest = new SearchRequestImpl();\n  searchRequest.setBase(safeDn);\n  searchRequest.setFilter(safeFilter);\n  c.search(searchRequest);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [LDAP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP ESAPI: [OWASP ESAPI](https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/).\n* Spring LdapQueryBuilder doc: [LdapQueryBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/query/LdapQueryBuilder.html).\n* Spring LdapNameBuilder doc: [LdapNameBuilder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/support/LdapNameBuilder.html).\n* UnboundID: [Understanding and Defending Against LDAP Injection Attacks](https://ldap.com/2018/05/04/understanding-and-defending-against-ldap-injection-attacks/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n",

An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range.

Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.\n\n```java\n\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern\npublic class Tester {\n    public static boolean is_valid_hex_color(String color) {\n        return Pattern.matches(\"#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}\", color);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nHowever, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a \"color\" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.\n\nThe fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.\n\n```javascript\n\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern\npublic class Tester {\n    public static boolean is_valid_hex_color(String color) {\n        return Pattern.matches(\"#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}\", color);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* GitHub Advisory Database: [CVE-2021-42740: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command in Shell-quote](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7)\n* wh0.github.io: [Exploiting CVE-2021-42740](https://wh0.github.io/2021/10/28/shell-quote-rce-exploiting.html)\n* Yosuke Ota: [no-obscure-range](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html)\n* Paul Boyd: [The regex \\[,-.\\]](https://pboyd.io/posts/comma-dash-dot/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n"

Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Java uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\nNote that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions can still be affected by this problem.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter. Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem.

Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Java uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\nNote that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions can still be affected by this problem.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter. Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```java\n\nif (str.length() > 1000) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n"

This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals.

The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=?

                  "markdown": "# Query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals.

If necessary, always validate the input, ideally against a fixed list of expected values.\n\nSimilarly, do not decide which permission to check for based on user data. In particular, avoid using computation to decide which permissions to check for. Use fixed permissions for particular actions, rather than generating the permission to check for.\n\n\n## Example\nThis example, using the Apache Shiro security framework, shows two ways to specify the permissions to check. The first way uses a string, `whatDoTheyWantToDo`, to specify the permissions to check. However, this string is built from user input. This can allow an attacker to force a check against a permission that they know they have, rather than the permission that should be checked. For example, while trying to access the account details of another user, the attacker could force the system to check whether they had permissions to access their *own* account details, which is incorrect, and would allow them to perform the action. The second, more secure way uses a fixed check that does not depend on data that is controlled by the user.\n\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\tString whatDoTheyWantToDo = args[0];\n\tSubject subject = SecurityUtils.getSubject();\n\n\t// BAD: permissions decision made using tainted data\n\tif(subject.isPermitted(\"domain:sublevel:\" + whatDoTheyWantToDo))\n\t\tdoIt();\n\n\t// GOOD: use fixed checks\n\tif(subject.isPermitted(\"domain:sublevel:whatTheMethodDoes\"))\n\t\tdoIt();\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [SEC02-J.

This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial of service, or server side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data. Denial of services can also be carried out in this situation.\n\nThere are many XML parsers for Java, and most of them are vulnerable to XXE because their default settings enable parsing of external entities. This query currently identifies vulnerable XML parsing from the following parsers: `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder`, `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`, `org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder`/`org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder`, `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser`,`org.dom4j.io.SAXReader`, `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource`, `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory`, `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` and `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe best way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the parsing of any Document Type Declarations (DTDs) in untrusted data. If this is not possible you should disable the parsing of external general entities and external parameter entities. This improves security but the code will still be at risk of denial of service and server side request forgery attacks. Protection against denial of service attacks may also be implemented by setting entity expansion limits, which is done by default in recent JDK and JRE implementations. We recommend visiting OWASP's [XML Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java), finding the specific XML parser, and applying the mitigation listed there. Other mitigations might be sufficient in some cases, but manual verification will be needed, as the query will continue to flag the parser as potentially dangerous.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `parse` on a `DocumentBuilder` that is not safely configured on untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic void parse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //unsafe\n}\n\n```\nIn this example, the `DocumentBuilder` is created with DTD disabled, securing it against XXE attack.\n\n\n```java\npublic void disableDTDParse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  factory.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true);\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //safe\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\n* OWASP guidance on parsing xml files: [XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java).\n* Paper by Timothy Morgen: [XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks](https://research.nccgroup.com/2014/05/19/xml-schema-dtd-and-entity-attacks-a-compendium-of-known-techniques/)\n* Out-of-band data retrieval: Timur Yunusov &amp; Alexey Osipov, Black hat EU 2013: [XML Out-Of-Band Data Retrieval](https://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4).\n* Denial of service attack (Billion laughs): [Billion Laughs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs)\n* The Java Tutorials: [Processing Limit Definitions.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/limits.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-776](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-827](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/827.html).\n",
