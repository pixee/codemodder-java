This change updates new array creation with [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#toArray-T:A-](Collection#toArray(T[])) to use an empty array argument, which is better for performance.

The point of the argument is to it an array to hold the objects and be returned, according to the documentation:

> If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.

Although it's not intuitive, allocating a right-sized array ahead of time to pass to the API appears to be [generally worse for performance](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/#_conclusion) according to benchmarking and JVM developers due to a number of implementation details in both Java and the virtual machine.   
 
For a real world example, consider [this issue in H2](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/311) where significant gains from using an empty array instead of a right-sized one.

Our changes look something like this:

```diff
- int[] tokenArray = tokens.toArray(new int[tokens.size()]);
+ int[] tokenArray = tokens.toArray(new int[0]);
  processTokens(tokenArray);
```
